# Thompsons-group

This repository contains a method for computing the normal form of an element in Thompson's group F. 

Definition: Thompson's group F is the group generated by infinitely many generators x_0, x_1, x_2, ... satisfying the relations<br/> 
x_k^{-1} x_n x_k = x_{n+1} for all k<n. 

Every element g of F can be expressed uniquely in the its normal form, i.e. <br/>
g = x_0^{a_0} ... x_n^{a_n} x_n^{-b_n} ... x_n^{-b_0} , <br/>
where a_0, ..., a_n, b_0, ..., b_n are non-negative integers, exactly one of a_n, b_n is non-zero, and: <br/>
(a_i and b_i not equal 0)    implies   (a_{i+1} not equal 0 or b_{i+1} not equal 0) ,<br/>
for all i.

The normal form can be computed via an algorithm from the article "Thompson's group and
public key cryptography" by Shpilrain and Ushakov, availble at
http://www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/~shpil/thomcryp.pdf

In Thompsonsgroup.py, this algorithm is implemented using Python.

## Example usage

In order to compute the normal form of the element g = x_3^2 x_0 x_2, enter
```python 
normalForm([ [3,2], [0,1], [2,1] ])
```
